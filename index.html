    <h3>The Heroic Life Of Pioneer Lagos Activist, Alimotu Pelewura</h3>
    <p>The pioneer female activist was a strong and radical woman who led the Lagos Market Women’s Association (LMWA) and popularly known for her outright opposition to several unfavorable policies particularly, the taxation policy by the British colonial government.
The Lagos Market Women's Association was one of the most important women's organization in Lagos during the colonial period.</p>
    <h3>Early Life</h3>
    <p>Chief Pelewura(1865–1951) was the elder of two children. Her mother was a fish trader and Pelewura also chose fish trading as an occupation. By 1900, she had become an <strong>important market women leader and trader</strong> and in 1910 was given a <strong>chieftaincy</strong> title by Oba Eshugbayi Eleko. 
      <p>In the 1920s, she was leader of the Ereko meat market and with the support of Herbert Macaulay, she rose to become the leader of the newly formed Lagos Market Women Association.</p>

    <h3>A Queen that took a stand....</h3>

  <p>In the 1932, Pelewura led market women in protest against direct taxation of women by the colonial government. When rumors surfaced about a proposed tax on women, Pelewura was a member of a committee of women that marched to the government house in protest against the proposed plan.
     <p>In the same year, due to her leadership of the protest, she was appointed as a women's representative in the Ilu Committee, an advisory group organized by the Oba of Lagos.</p>
    <p>In the mid 1930s, she led a protest against the relocation of the Ereko market to the Oluwole area of Lagos, Pelewura and some Ereko women attempted to physically block any relocation action by authorities which led to her detention. The market women in Lagos rallied in her support and she and other women detainees were released.</p>
    <p>PeleWura wielded so much power that she became a source of concern to the colonial government. </p>

<p>She was jailed severally, but that didn’t stop her from continuing her life of activism and struggles to make life easier for women.</P>
